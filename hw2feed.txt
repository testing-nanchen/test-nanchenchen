post: Hey all, if you're still having trouble with using your terminal to find your homework and interacting with git - or even if you just need a refresher on how to use either - we've posted a brief walkthrough/tutorial here: <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118657/pages/using-your-terminal-+-git>

reply: also, to emphasize one of the comments — different operating systems and and encodings will result in different totals!
from: Sean Munson
post: And one more thing — for Canvas uploads, don’t worry about screenshots fro HW1. Canvas uploads are also optional, but we still recommend uploading your finished hw1-part1.py, hw1-part2.py, hw1-part3.py just in case there are issues with github classroom (it’s still new to us)
from: Sean Munson
post: One other note, there’s a typo on line 31 referring to hw2feed; we that should be hw1feed.
from: Sean Munson
post: For hw1-part3.py, your character count can include or not include end of line (\n) characters. We were a little inconsistent between the examples and the instructions, so either is fine.

reply: Great, thanks so much!

reply: also, if it helps to look at the Zelle book to decide if it is helpful for you, TAs and I have copies (one TA copy is on Christina’s desk)

post: For hw1-part3, if you are running Python in a non-English environment (e.g., your operating system is configured to a different location), you *may* need to add `encoding='UTF-8'` to when you open a file. E.g., `f = open('myfile.txt','r',encoding='utf-8')`  Thanks to <@U7AHD4HD5> for bringing this up.

reply: oh ok! thank you. :blush:

post: hello! should we hand in a pdf with parts 6, 7, and 8 or should we hand in hw0.py, hw0.txt, and our screenshot? the instructions for the homework says the following:  &gt; Attach a single document (PDF preferred), containing &gt; A screenshot of running your edited hw0.py (part 6) &gt; Text you write for parts 7 and 8, in hw0.txt  &gt; To turn it in on Canvas, visit the course page, click on assignments, find hw0, and upload hw0.py, hw0.txt, and your screenshot.  not quite sure which set of instructions to follow. thank you in advance! :blush:
from: Asikur Rahman
reply: Okay, thanks.
from: Sean Munson
reply: that should be okay. It used Python 3, which is what matters most. Some of the readings may not line up perfectly (and some of the review questions will be different), so just be aware of that when I suggest readings

post: One other note — DRS is looking for at least two notetakers to assist a student this quarter. Please consider notetaking as it will help your peer gain access to material from class. Notetakers will receive a letter of recommendation for their service from the Director of Disability Resources for Students when the quarter is complete.  (I also think that taking notes meant to be understandable by others can also be a valuable exercise for yourself.)  Now that you all know the structure of the class, and the general plan to make most slides available before class starts, please consider this request and message me privately if you’d be willing to help take notes.

post: hi all — some of you are finding that when you first open your hw in pycharm, the run button is disabled. To get around this (after you have selected a Python interpreter), you should be able to right click on hw0.py in the sidebar and select run
